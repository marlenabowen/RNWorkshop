# RNWorkshop

### Preparatory steps

This project can be run after setting React Native up on your machine. Follow the instructions on this [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) page.

### Installation

1. If you are already using git on your machine, you can clone this repo using

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mebowen/RNWorkshop.git
```
OR

1. If you do not have git installed on your machine, download this project as a zip file. Click the green `Clone or download` button in the top right corner of this page and select `Download ZIP`

2. After unzipping the file, I recommend moving the unzipped file onto your desktop for easy access.

3. In your terminal, navigate to your Desktop directory. From your home directory, you can usually access the Desktop via

```
$ cd Desktop
```

4. From your Desktop directory in your terminal, access the RNWorkshop project directory via

```
$cd RNWorkshop
```

5. Next, you will need to install Node Package Manager. If you are on a Windows machine, you may need to do some Googling to figure out how to do this properly.

```
$ npm install
```

### Running the project

1. If you are on iOS, run:

```
$ react-native run-ios
```

OR 

1. If you are on android, run:

```
$ react-native run-android
```

If you are on android and that command does not work for you, try opening your project in Android Studio, then opening the emulator via `Tools` -> `Android` -> `AVD Manager`. Then, in your terminal (in the RNWorkshop directory), run:

```
$ npm start
```
